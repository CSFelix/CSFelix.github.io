<h1 align="center">🌟 Code of Conduct 🌟</h1>

- Beautiful is better than ugly;

- Explicit is better than implicit;

- Simple is better than complex;

- Complex is better than complicated;

- Flat is better than nested;

- Sparse is better than dense;

- Readability counts;

- Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules;

- Although practicality beats purity;

- Errors should never pass silently;

- Unless explicitly silenced;

- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess;

- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it;

- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch;

- Now is better than never;

- Although never is often better than *right* now;
-
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea;

- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea;

- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let’s do more of those.
